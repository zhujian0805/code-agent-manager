# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit of the Code Assistant Manager (CAM) reveals several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities in API key management, command execution, and input validation. The application serves as a unified interface for multiple AI coding assistants but has significant security gaps that could lead to privilege escalation, data exposure, and arbitrary command execution.

The most critical issues involve unsafe handling of environment variables containing API keys, inadequate input validation for commands, and potential command injection vulnerabilities when executing external tools. The application also has multiple configuration files scattered across the user's system that may contain sensitive information.

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. API Key Exposure in Environment Variables
- **Location**: `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/tools/env_builder.py`, `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/tools/goose.py`
- **Description**: The application stores API keys in environment variables that are directly passed to external processes, exposing them to potential logging, debugging, or unauthorized access. The `ToolEnvironmentBuilder.set_api_key()` method directly assigns sensitive API keys from configuration to environment variables without sanitization or encryption.
- **Impact**: API keys can be leaked through process lists, logs, or child processes, allowing unauthorized access to AI services and potential billing fraud.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement secure credential passing without environment variables (use configuration files with proper permissions)
  - [ ] Add API key masking in command output and logging
  - [ ] Encrypt sensitive credentials in configuration files
  - [ ] Use secure temporary files for API keys instead of environment variables

### 2. Command Injection in Endpoint Configuration
- **Location**: `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/config.py`, `/home/jzhu/code_assistant-manager/code_assistant_manager/tools/goose.py`
- **Description**: The application executes commands from `list_models_cmd` configuration field without proper validation. In Goose tool implementation, commands are executed using `subprocess.run()` with shell=True, creating a command injection risk if the endpoint configuration contains malicious commands.
- **Impact**: Attackers with access to configuration files can execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Remove all instances of `shell=True` in subprocess calls
  - [ ] Implement proper command validation and sanitization
  - [ ] Use `shlex.split()` and pass commands as lists instead of strings
  - [ ] Add validation for the `list_models_cmd` field to prevent dangerous patterns

### 3. Insecure Configuration File Permissions
- **Location**: Multiple files in `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/mcp/`, `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/tools/`
- **Description**: The application creates configuration files (like `.json`, `.yaml`) in user home directories without enforcing proper file permissions. These files may contain sensitive information like API keys, tokens, and credentials.
- **Impact**: Other users on the system could access sensitive configuration files and extract API keys or other credentials.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Set proper file permissions (600) when creating configuration files
  - [ ] Add file permission validation in configuration loading functions
  - [ ] Implement secure file creation with proper permissions from the start
  - [ ] Add file permission checking before reading configuration files

## High Vulnerabilities

### 1. Path Traversal in Agent Download Functionality
- **Location**: `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/agents/base.py`
- **Description**: The `_download_repo()` function extracts ZIP archives without validating file paths, allowing for directory traversal attacks. The `agent_file` parameter could contain path traversal sequences like `../../../` that could allow writing to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.
- **Impact**: Attackers could overwrite system files or create files in sensitive locations by crafting malicious agent repositories.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement path traversal protection using `os.path.realpath()` and `os.path.commonpath()`
  - [ ] Validate extracted file paths against the intended extraction directory
  - [ ] Add path normalization and validation before file operations
  - [ ] Implement secure archive extraction with path validation

### 2. Insecure Deserialization in Configuration Loading
- **Location**: `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/config.py`, `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/mcp/base.py`
- **Description**: The application uses `json.load()` and `yaml.safe_load()` to load configuration files without proper validation of content structure. While `yaml.safe_load()` is used, there's potential for YAML-specific attacks if not properly implemented.
- **Impact**: Malicious configuration files could contain crafted payloads that could lead to code execution or denial of service.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Add schema validation for all configuration files
  - [ ] Implement content validation before deserialization
  - [ ] Add proper error handling for malformed configuration files
  - [ ] Consider using a more restrictive deserialization approach

### 3. Information Disclosure Through Verbose Error Messages
- **Location**: Multiple files across the codebase, particularly `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/cli/app.py`, `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/tools/base.py`
- **Description**: The application displays detailed error messages including API keys, command strings, and system paths in various error handling scenarios, which could leak sensitive information.
- **Impact**: Sensitive information such as API endpoints, API keys, and system paths could be exposed to users or logged inappropriately.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement generic error messages for production environments
  - [ ] Add sensitive information filtering in error messages
  - [ ] Create separate error handling for debug vs. production modes
  - [ ] Sanitize error messages before display or logging

## Medium Vulnerabilities

### 1. Inadequate Input Validation for Command Arguments
- **Location**: `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/config.py`
- **Description**: The command validation function allows potentially dangerous patterns like pipes and command chaining which could be exploited in certain contexts.
- **Impact**: While some protection exists, the validation logic is complex and may have bypasses, allowing for limited command injection.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement stricter command validation with allowlists
  - [ ] Add comprehensive input sanitization for all command parameters
  - [ ] Use secure subprocess execution with command arrays instead of shell strings
  - [ ] Add validation for all user-provided command strings

### 2. Weak Authentication in MCP Server Configuration
- **Location**: `/home/jzhu/code-agent-manager/code_assistant_manager/mcp/`
- **Description**: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations may not properly validate authentication for external servers, potentially allowing unauthorized access to system resources through configured MCP servers.
- **Impact**: Malicious MCP servers could potentially access system resources or perform unauthorized operations through the AI assistant.
- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Implement proper authentication validation for MCP servers
  - [ ] Add secure connection verification for external MCP servers
  - [ ] Implement access controls for MCP server operations
  - [ ] Add validation for MCP server configuration parameters

### 3. Unsafe Package Installation
