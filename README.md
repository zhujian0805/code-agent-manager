**One CLI to Rule Them All.**
<br>
Tired of juggling multiple AI coding assistants? **CAM** is a unified Go CLI to manage configurations, instructions, skills, plugins, MCP servers, and launch settings for **17 AI assistants** including Claude, Codex, Gemini, Qwen, Copilot, Blackbox, Goose, Continue, and more from a single terminal interface.

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

Since CAM is distributed from source, build and install the Go binaries locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Chat2AnyLLM/code-agent-manager.git
cd code-agent-manager

# Run the install script
./install.sh
```

### Alternative Methods

```bash
# Install using the install script directly
./install.sh

# Or install from the web
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chat2AnyLLM/code-agent-manager/main/install.sh | bash

# Install from source directly
git clone https://github.com/Chat2AnyLLM/code-agent-manager.git
cd code-agent-manager
go test ./...
go build -o dist/cam ./cmd/cam
```

---

## Quick Start

1. **Create your base config files**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/code-agent-manager
   touch ~/.env
   chmod 600 ~/.env
   ```

2. **Set up your API keys** in `.env`:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
   export GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"
   ```

3. **Source the environment file and verify setup:**
   ```bash
   source ~/.env
   cam doctor
   ```

4. **Launch the interactive menu:**
   ```bash
   cam launch
   ```

5. **Select your assistant and start coding!**

## Desktop App and Developer Workflow

CAM now uses a **Tauri desktop shell** with a **Go sidecar API**. The same Go backend packages power both the terminal CLI and the desktop UI, so provider and launch behavior stays consistent across interfaces.

### Start the desktop app

Use `make start` from the repository root:

```bash
make start
```

`make start`, `make app`, and `make dev` all run the same full desktop startup path. They build the Go sidecar expected by Tauri, start the Vite frontend dev server through Tauri, and open the desktop window.

### Start browser-only frontend

Use this when you only want the React UI in a browser with mock/fallback data or a manually configured sidecar URL:

```bash
make frontend
```

The browser frontend listens on `http://127.0.0.1:5173` by default. Override the host or port when needed:

```bash
make frontend FRONTEND_HOST=127.0.0.1 FRONTEND_PORT=5174
```

### Start the Go sidecar directly

Use this for API testing without opening the desktop window:

```bash
make sidecar
```

By default, the sidecar binds to `127.0.0.1` and chooses a random port (`SIDECAR_PORT=0`). It prints startup JSON containing the selected port and bearer token. Override values when needed:

```bash
make sidecar SIDECAR_PORT=54321
```

### Build desktop assets and sidecar

```bash
make desktop-build
```

This runs the frontend production build, builds the Go sidecar, and checks the Tauri shell with Cargo. On Windows, the Makefile sets `CARGO_HTTP_CHECK_REVOKE=false` to avoid certificate revocation-check failures when Cargo downloads crates.

### Other useful make targets

```bash
make start  # start the full Tauri desktop app
make build   # build CLI binaries and sidecar into dist/
make test    # run Go tests
make check   # run Go vet, Go tests, frontend tests/build, sidecar build, and cargo check
make clean   # remove generated build outputs
```

### Configuration files

CAM uses these main configuration files:

- `~/.config/code-agent-manager/cam.db`: SQLite app state database that stores providers and other state.
- `~/.env`: API keys and sensitive environment variables.
- `~/.config/code-agent-manager/config.yaml`: repository-source config for instructions, skills, agents, and plugins.

### How `config.yaml` is used for instruction/skill/agent/plugin repos

- CAM loads `~/.config/code-agent-manager/config.yaml` first; if missing, it falls back to the bundled Go config at `internal/camconfig/embed/config.yaml`.
- The file defines source lists for `instructions`, `skills`, `agents`, and `plugins`.
- Local JSON sources (`instruction_repos.json`, `skill_repos.json`, `agent_repos.json`, `plugin_repos.json`) are loaded first.
- Remote sources are merged after local sources and do not override existing local keys.
- Remote responses are cached in `~/.cache/code-agent-manager/repos` (TTL controlled by `config.yaml`).

## Why CAM?

In the era of AI-driven development, developers often use multiple powerful assistants like Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini. However, this leads to a fragmented and inefficient workflow:

- **Scattered Configurations:** Each tool has its own setup, API keys, and configuration files.
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** System prompts and custom instructions diverge, leading to different AI behaviors across projects.
- **Wasted Time:** Constantly switching between different CLIs and UIs is a drain on productivity.

CAM solves this by providing a single, consistent interface to manage everything, turning a chaotic toolkit into a cohesive and powerful development partner.
